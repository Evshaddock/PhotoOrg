Q: What specifically does this do?

Lets you select a batch of images, and automatically copy and organize it into it's own discreet folder.


For example: Say you're using multiple SD Cards, and you have an assistant at the computer ready to take the cutsomers info
while you move on to the next customers photos, they can quickly select all the photos that customer would like printed, get
their relevant information, and save it all to a single folder, named appropriately, so that when they get around to, say
printing a customers photo, it would be very easy to find exactly the right files and info.
