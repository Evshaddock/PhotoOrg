Q: What specifically does this do?

Lets you select a batch of images, and automatically copy and organize it into it's own discreet folder.


For example: Say you're using multiple SD Cards, and you have an assistant at the computer ready to take the cutsomers info
while you move on to the next customers photos, they can quickly select all the photos that customer would like printed, get
their relevant information, and save it all to a single folder, named appropriately, so that when they get around to, say
printing a customers photo, it would be very easy to find exactly the right files and info.

Theming is controled through ini files in the settings folder, they have discreet sections for each component, with values for Red, Green and Blue (In that order). All themes are loaded into the theme list on startup

You may use a Background image by placing the desired image in '/img' in the settings folder and naming it (without extension) at the bottom of the theme file. keep as 'none' for no bg image
